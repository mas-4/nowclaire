A dead simple static site generator

## Why?

A while back I wrote a static site generator called bluesky that essentially mimicked the functionality of [Sergey][sg].
It was called bluesky and it was written in C++.

But I don't like C++. I like C. I just suck at it.

So I wrote it in C++ because it was a complex project (a templating engine specifically) which required some level of sophistication
in relation to scanning and lexing that I lacked.

Since I'm reading [Crafting Interpreters][ci] I figured I'd come back and rewrite it in C.

```html
<nowclaire-include name="_nav.html"/>

<nowclaire-md-include path="hello.md"/>

<nowclaire-template name="_imports/template.html"/>

<nowclaire-block name="content">
    Hello, world!
</nowclaire-block>

<nowclaire-slot name="content"/>

<nowclaire-markdown
        slot="content"
        directory="posts"
        title="title"
        sort="date"
        order="descending"
        template="_imports/post.html"
/>
<h1>${meta.site_title}</h1>
```

# Modified original readme from bluesky with commands translated to nowclaire

I'm sick of ultra complex static site generators.

Especially when the functionality could be easily reproduced if html
implemented these basic features:

1. HTML includes (just like #include in c/cpp, drop the included file
   wholecloth into the including file)
2. HTML templates (the reverse of #include, drop the templated file directly
   into the template, using named slots)
3. HTML markdown (create a template for each markdown file, generate a list
   of links, and convert every file within a directory into an html page
   using the template)

The closest thing to doing just that I've found is [Sergey][sg]
which is a nice little project written as a single file of JavaScript.

That's cool and all, and I use it, but its JavaScript (ðŸ¤®ðŸ˜œ).

C++ is also gross, but way easier than C, which I do want to eventually convert this to. And, you know, my dog died, and
I wanted to make something named after her. Pic coming soon.

So, this is for you, Sky Blue.

# Usage

To build a site:

```
nowclaire -i ./src -o ./build
```

To use the development server:

```
nowclaire -i ./src -h 0.0.0.0
```

The host can be any ip with a colon port. The default port is `8080` if no port is provided. You can't call `-h` without
an argument (a limitation of non-gnu getopt implementations) but if you want to use the default
ip/port, `127.0.0.1:8080`:

```
nowclaire -i ./src -h ""
```

`-v` is verbose mode, which I find useful.

# Syntax

## Include

```html

<nowclaire-include name="_nav.html"/>
```

Will automatically include `src/_imports/_nav.html` wholesale, and also parse it (i.e., `_nav.html` can include
other includes). The underscore is unnecessary.

## Markdown Include

There are also markdown includes:

```html

<nowclaire-md-include path="hello.md"/>
```

will render `hello.md` as html and drop it in that spot same as a regular include.

## Templates

```html

<nowclaire-template name="_imports/template.html"/>
<nowclaire-block name="content">
    Hello, world!
</nowclaire-block>
```

Will render with this template:

```html

<DOCTYPE !html>
    <body>
    <nowclaire-slot name="content"/>
    </body>
```

into

```html

<DOCTYPE !html>
    <body>
    Hello, world!
    </body>
```

## Markdown

Given a file like this:

```html

<nowclaire-template name="_imports/template.html"/>
<nowclaire-block name="content"/>
<nowclaire-markdown
        slot="content"
        directory="posts"
        title="title"
        sort="date"
        order="descending"
        template="_imports/post.html"
/>
</nowclaire-block>
```

The file in question will render with an unordered list of links, using the `title` variable from the frontmatter as
the anchor text, the template as the template for the rendered markdown (assuming markdown files in the `directory`),
the `date` variable from the frontmatter as the sort key, in order `descending`, and sticking the rendered markdown
in the slot `content` in the markdown template `_imports/post.html`.

## Variables

Finally, you can use variables from a `meta` file in the root of `src` anywhere:

```
site_title=bluesky
```

```html
<h1>${meta.site_title}</h1>
```

will render

```html
<h1>bluesky</h1>
```

and in the template for markdown posts you can use the frontmatter variables like so:

```html
<h1>${frontmatter.title}</h1>
```

And that's all there is to it.
